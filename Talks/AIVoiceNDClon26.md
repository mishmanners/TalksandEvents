## Talk Title

### 🤖 Skills for the age of AI tools: How to effectively use the technology available

#### Voice is the next frontier for AI

## Abstract

I love playing Magic: The Gathering (MTG), but I can never remember all the different mechanics, keywords, or interactions. So, I built an AI voice assistant to help us play.

By combining speech-to-text, large language models, and text-to-speech, this assistant can explain rules, and guide us through in-game actions, all powered by natural conversation.

In this talk, I’ll walk through how I built the MTG AI assistant, share live demos of it in action, and show how developers can apply the same techniques to their own projects; whether you are building something for yourself, or something for a large user base. Along the way, we’ll explore why voice is the next frontier for AI, how it can make apps more accessible and engaging, and why developers should be experimenting with it right now.

Whether you’re into games, productivity, or just building cool stuff, this session will show you how to turn spoken words into powerful, voice-driven applications.
