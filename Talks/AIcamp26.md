# AI Camp Melbourne Meetup May 2026

Abstract:

I love playing Magic: The Gathering (MTG), but I can never remember every mechanic, keyword, or weird interaction… So, I built an AI voice assistant to help. By combining speech-to-text, large language models, and text-to-speech, my assistant can explain rules and guide in-game actions through natural conversation. In this talk, I’ll break down how I built it, share live demos, and show how you can use the same approach in your own projects, regardless of whether you’re building for yourself or a large user base. We’ll also dig into why voice is AI’s next frontier and why you should experiment now.
