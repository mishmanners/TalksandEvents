## Talk Title

### AI ðŸ¤– and the future of work: How to build resilience to ensure you still have a job

## Abstract

What skills are needed to ensure I still have a job, and how do I obtain them?

With the rise of AI and automation, how do we as humans find our value in the workplace? How do we work with these new technologises? How do we build resilience to changes? What soft skills are needed for us to thrive in this new world?

People have often felt apprehensive about change, especially big changes to the way we work. It happened in the industrial revolution and now it's happening with the rise of artificial intelligence. Five years ago these things existed, but now they are accessible to almost everyone, and in a lot of cases they are doing our jobs for us.

In this session I'll cover:

Why people want to work
Why is this industrial revolution different to the others
What is AI and its applications
What skills are needed for the ""age of AI""
How do we obtain those skills
What's next for the future of work
