## Talk Title

### Skills for the age of AI developer tools ðŸ¤– How to build resilience and effectively use the technology available

## Abstract

With the rise of AI and automation, how do we as humans find our value in the workplace? How do we work with these new technologies? How do we build resilience to changes? What skills are needed for us to thrive in this new world?

People have often felt apprehensive about change, especially big changes to the way we work. It happened in the industrial revolution and now it's happening with the rise of artificial intelligence. Five years ago these things existed, but now they are accessible to almost everyone.

In this session I'll cover:

- What is work and why should we work
- Industrial revolutions
- Artificial Intelligence and applications
- Fears and concerns
- Working with AI
- Skills for AI developer tooling
- Soft skills and how to cultivate them
