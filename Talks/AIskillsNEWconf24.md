## Talk title

### Skills for the Age of AI

## Abstract

What skills are needed to ensure I still have a job, and how do I obtain them?

With the rise of AI and automation, how do we as humans find our value in the workplace? How do we work with these new technologises? How do we build resilience to changes? What soft skills are needed for us to thrive in this new world?

People have often felt apprehensive about change, especially big changes to the way we work. It happened in the industrial revolution and now it’s happening with the rise of artificial intelligence. Five years ago these things existed, but now they are accessible to almost everyone.

In this session I’ll cover:

- why people want to work
- why it’s important for us to have a place in the world
- what skills are needed for the “age of AI”. (We are talking about soft skills here)
- what is AI and its applications
- how we build resilience, problem solving, and critical thinking
