## Talk Title

### Culture and collaboration: DevOps Lightning talk ⚡

## Abstract

It’s widely accepted that DevOps is as much a cultural shift as it is about the technology that’s used. DevOps consists of four main pillars, one of which is collaboration.

In this lightning talk, I'll cover the future of work, soft skills, why collaboration is important, and how developers and non-developers can work better together.
