## Talk title

_DevOps Isn't Just About Developing_

## Abstract

It’s widely accepted that DevOps is as much a cultural shift as it is about the technology that’s used. DevOps consists of four main pillars, one of which is collaboration.

In this session I’ll talk about why collaboration is important and how developers and non-developers can work better together. I’ll also gives you some tips on tools to use for more effective collaboration and teamwork across multidisciplinary teams.
