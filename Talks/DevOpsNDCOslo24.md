# NDC Oslo 2024 - DevOps isn't just about developing

This is a talk I gave at [NDC Oslo 2023](https://ndcoslo.com/speakers/michelle-mannering).


[Listen to the recording](). COMING SOON.

## Talk Title

### DevOps isn't just about developing

## Abstract

It's widely accepted that DevOps is as much a cultural shift as it is about the technology that's used. DevOps consists of four main pillars, one of which is collaboration.

Collaboration is so important, it's also nothing new. As our future of work is moving towards this soft skill, how do we find our ultimate dream team, and work effectively across an entire organisation to build the best products and services?

In this session I'll talk about why collaboration is important and how developers and non-developers can work better together. I'll also give you some tips on tools to use for more effective collaboration and teamwork across multidisciplinary teams.
