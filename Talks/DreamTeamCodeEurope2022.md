This is a talk I gave at [Code Europe in 2022](https://www.codeeurope.pl/en/speakers/michelle-mannering).

## Talk Title

### The Dream Team: working effectively across multidisciplinary teams

## Abstract

The future of work is moving towards soft skills; teamwork, collaboration, communication. In an age where these skills are important, how do we find our ultimate dream team, and work effectively across an entire organisation to build the best products and services.
