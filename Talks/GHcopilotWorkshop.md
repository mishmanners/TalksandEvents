Read below for the resources that you can keep after the workshop.

## Workshop Title

### Supercharge your workflow with GitHub's modes, models, and methods

## Abstract

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting your coding journey, GitHub Copilot is your pair programmer, productivity booster, and creative collaborator. In this hands-on, four-hour workshop, we’ll take a deep dive into the full potential of GitHub Copilot, which goes beyond the magic of simply autocomplete.
Find out more about GitHub Copilot, new features, updates, and see a demo.

We'll break down GitHub Copilot's different methods of use (autocomplete, inline suggestions, and chat) as well as different ways of interacting with GitHub Copilot (web, Copilot for CLI, Docs, and even on mobile). We'll look at the different modes that GitHub Copilot now has available (ask, edit, and agent) and lookin into the various models in use. We'll discuss how you can choose the model that works for you. We'll walk through how you can incorporate Copilot into your development workflows effectively and ethically.

Participants will learn about the MCP (Multimodal Copilot Platform) and how it powers GitHub’s AI features across the ecosystem and you’ll discover how to work with Copilot in various environments, tailor its suggestions, debug code, write tests, and even co-create documentation.

By the end of this workshop you'll have learned:

✅ How to use GitHub Copilot's different modes, models, and methods

✅ How to use prompt engineering for better results

✅ How to choose between various models based on real-world use cases across programming languages and stacks

✅ How to use GitHub Copilot responsibly: code quality, copyright, and collaboration

✅ How to use Advanced Copilot Chat capabilities for problem-solving and code explanation

✅ Other ways GitHub Copilot can help with your workflow: Documentation, PRs, and reviews

✅ What is MCP and how it relates to GitHub Copilot

Whether you're looking to save time, spark innovation, or deepen your understanding of AI-assisted development, this workshop will equip you with actionable techniques and confidence to use GitHub Copilot like a pro.
