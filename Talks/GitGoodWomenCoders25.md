## Talk Title

### Git Good and level up your version control 

## Abstract

Ever accidentally deleted a file and wished there was an "undo" button? Have you struggled to collaborate on code without chaos? Enter Git. It's the ultimate time machine for developers. Whether you're new to coding or never really understood Git beyond git clone, we'll break it all down in this talk, because version control shouldn't feel like rocket science.

In this talk we'll explore why Git exists, how it helps teams (and even solo developers) stay sane when building projects. We'll demystify terms like commits, branches, and merge conflicts. I'll give you some practical tips to Git Good, and you'll walk away, armed with the knowledge to put version control into practice.

What You'll Learn:

- What is version control
- What is Git
- Why Git is essential for every developer
- How to track changes, collaborate, and avoid disasters
- The magic of branches and why you should use them
- How to recover from mistakes like a pro
- How you can use GitHub with Git
- What to do when you get stuck

No prior Git experience required. All genders are welcome to attend!
