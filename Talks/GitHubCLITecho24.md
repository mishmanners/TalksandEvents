## Talk Title

### Working with the GitHub CLI

## Abstract

The GitHub CLI is your ticket to using GitHub on the Command Line. At GitHub, we love developers to work the way they want. Some like to work in the browser, others in the editor, and some don't even want to leave their terminal. With the GitHub CLI, you never have to leave the command line. Perform all your favourite GitHub commands directly from the terminal; open an issue, check out a PR, merge some code and more. There are also hundreds of extensions available, both from GitHub and from the community. Come along to this session and see how to level up your terminal skills with GitHub CLI.

Takeaways:
- Learn about the GitHub CLI is and why you should use it
- Learn the features of the CLI and how it can help your workflow
- Learn about some useful extensions to do more with the CLI
- Find out how you can contribute and build your own
