**[Recording coming soon]**

## Talk Title

### Level up with GitHub Copilot: Using AI to help you learn, code, and build

## Abstract

It's time you meet your AI pair programmer. Do you find yourself stuck on a chunk of code? Unsure of how best to center a div? GitHub Copilot can help. Get unstuck by seeing suggested lines or code, whole functions, and learn more about your development journey through having code explained, and even translate your code into other languages.

Find out more about GitHub Copilot, new features, updates, and see a demo.

The session will cover:
- What is AI
- Applications of AI
- How GitHub Copilot works
- AI pair programming
- How to get better results from GitHub Copilot with prompt engineering (the art crafting effective prompts)
- Power of conversational coding with GitHub Copilot Chat
