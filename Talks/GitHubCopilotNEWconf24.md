Find out more about GitHub Copilot, new features, updates, and see a demo.

The session will cover:
- What is AI
- Applications of AI
- How GitHub Copilot works
- How to get better results from GitHub Copilot with prompt engineering (the art crafting effective prompts)
- Power of conversational coding with GitHub Copilot Chat
- What's coming next
