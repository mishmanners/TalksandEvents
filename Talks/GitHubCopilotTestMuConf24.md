## Talk Title

### Master Test Writing with GitHub Copilot

## Abstract

Unleash the power of GitHub Copilot, your AI pair programmer. GitHub Copilot can be a game-changer when it comes to writing tests. GitHub Copilot can generate code snippets based on your .natural language descriptions.

In this session we'll introduce you to GitHub Copilot and how it leverages machine learning to assist developers in writing code. When it comes to writing code however, many developers enjoy focusing on the code aspect. We love writing code and moving onto the next exciting project. Writing tests is an important aspect of software development, and one many developers dread doing.

We'll cover the different types of tests, and how to use GitHub Copilot to help you write different types of tests for your projects. We'll discuss some of the best practices when it comes to prompt engineering, and how to get the most out of GitHub Copilot.

Key Takeaways:

- Introduction to GitHub and how it leverages machine learning to provide lines or whole code functions
- The basics of testing: why it's important, different test types
- Using GitHub Copilot to write tests
- Generating test cases
- Testing automation
- How to get the most out of GitHub Copilot (prompt engineering)
