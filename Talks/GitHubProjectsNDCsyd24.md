## Talk Title

### How I used GitHub Projects to move my house

## Abstract

GitHub Projects is an often forgotten or underutilised GitHub feature. It's a powerful tool for managing your projects, whether they be software development, or a personal hobby.

This adaptable, flexible tool for planning and tracking work can be used by developers and non-developers alike. It's one of the best ways you can have your team working together across all disciplines.

In this talk, you'll see GitHub Projects in action, and see how I used GitHub issues, forms, tasks, milestones, timelines, and automation to help plan my house move.
