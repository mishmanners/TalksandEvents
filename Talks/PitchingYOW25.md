# YOW! Tech Leaders Summit - Pitch Like a Pro

### How to effectively present your idea

This is for the talk I gave at [YOW! Tech Leaders Summit 2025](https://yowcon.com/tech-leaders-melbourne-2025/sessions/3750/how-to-effectively-pitch-your-idea).

## Pitch Like a Pro

### How to effectively present your idea

## Abstract

When it comes to building a business, or creating a team, you will be required to pitch your ideas. Selling your idea to investors, stakeholders, PR companies, potential teammates, partners, and event organisations will be crucial to the success of your idea.

How does one do this effectively without sounding egotistical? I'll teach you the MAGIC formula for pitching any idea, any game, to anyone. You can use this magic formula for an elevator pitch, a 5 minute lighting round, a 20 minute session, or even an hour long workshop.

At the end of my session, you'll walk away with a playbook on how to "sell" your idea, get people on board with your proposal, and make real changes. You'll also receive tips and tricks for effectively presenting to your audience; whether that's a big board room conversation, a presentation on stage, or even just a coffee chat.
