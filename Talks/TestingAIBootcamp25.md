This is the talk I gave at [Global AI Bootcamp Melbourne](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-azure-nights/events/306036197/).

## Ensuring Quality Testing in an AI-Driven World

### Master Test Writing with GitHub Copilot

## Abstract

As artificial intelligence continues to reshape the software development landscape, testing is evolving at a rapid pace. Traditional testing methods are being augmented or replaced, by AI-driven automation, predictive analytics, and intelligent quality assurance. But with these advancements come new challenges. Can AI really understand human intent? How do we ensure fairness, reliability, and ethical considerations? Where does empathy fit in a world increasingly dominated by algorithms?

In this keynote, we’ll explore the intersection of AI and software testing, diving into how quality assurance professionals can adapt, innovate, and stay ahead. We’ll discuss the role of human oversight in AI-driven testing, strategies for balancing automation with critical thinking, and the future of testing in an era where software quality directly impacts real-world experiences.

It's an exciting future of testing, where AI enhances our capabilities, yet human empathy and intuition remain irreplaceable.

In this talk, I'll cover:
- Evolution of software testing
- What is AI-driven testing
- How to effectively use AI in testing
- Role of people in testing
- Future of testing
